# Shopify Technical Challenge Backend

I combined the frontend and backend into its own repo here. However when cloning to run locally use the links provided to the separate repos. Github removed some files in this repo so you will not be able to get the front-end setup if you use the ones that are here

Front-end: https://github.com/salmanshaikh733/Shopify-Technical-Challenge2022-FrontEnd

Back-end: https://github.com/salmanshaikh733/Shopify-Technical-Challenge2022-BackEnd
